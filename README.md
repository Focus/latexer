# latexer

Latexer is a package to help you with your every day LaTeX needs. It does reference, citation and environment autocompletion on the fly or at the touch of a keystroke.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Focus/latexer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Focus/latexer)

Features
--------

### Reference autocompletion

  ![Autocompletion of references](https://github.com/Focus/latexer/raw/master/screenshots/ref.gif)
Triggers:
  * Typing in `\ref{`, `\eqref{` or any control sequences that ends in `ref{`
  * Deleting anything so that the left of the cursor reads `\ref{`, `\eqref{`, and the like. E.g. deleting the word 'something' from `\pageref{something}`
  * Custom Triggers can be added via settings

### Bibliography and citation autocompletion

#### Latexer finds your bibfiles

Latexer will automatically scan your document to find your bibfiles. For example, if your document contains the command `\bibliography{mybib1.bib, mybib2}`, latexer will find and then scan through the files named `mybib1.bib` and `mymbib2.bib` to get the citations. Additionally, Latexer will look for BibTeX files given in the current file of the form `\addbibresource` and `\addglobalbib`.

*You can also specify bibfiles using a  [YAML metadata block](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block)* at the top of your document. If you choose to write in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#syntax) on [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), Latexer will automatically look for the `bibliography` key in your YAML and scan any files specified for citations.


#### Latexer can autocomplete your LaTeX citations

##### LaTeX Triggers

  * Typing in `\cite{`, `\citet{`, `\citet*{`, `\citep{`, `\citep*{`, or any control sequences that end in `cite{`. You can also write something in square brackets before, e.g. `\cite[Theorem 1]{` or `\cite[See:][Page 51-59]{`
  * Deleting anything so that the left of the cursor reads `\cite{`, `\textcite{`, `\citet{`, `\citet*{`, `\citep{` or `\citep*{`, e.g. deleting the word 'something' from `\cite{something}`
  * Custom Triggers can be added via settings

##### [Pandoc-style Citation][1] Triggers

- Typing `[@` or `[-@` to begin a pandoc-style citation
- Typing `@` or `-@` after semicolon-delimited references in a pandoc-style citation, for example: `[@ref1; @` and `[@ref3; also see @ref4; @`

You can edit from the preferences window which parameters you would like to search the bibliographies by. The default is `title,author`, but you can specify whichever search fields you like. For example, `key,year` will search for an entry entries by its key, i.e. `@key{...}` and the year it was published.


### Environment autocompletion

  ![Autocompletion of environments](https://github.com/Focus/latexer/raw/master/screenshots/env.gif)
Triggers:
  * Having an unmatched `\begin{env_name}` or `\[` in the line above.

### Multifile support

For multifile support, from the child files use `%!TEX root = mainfile.tex` to point to the root file.


Options
--------

You can switch off any of the autocompletions in the settings menu. If you prefer a manual approach you can bind keys as follows. First go to `Atom>Open Your Keymap` and then paste the following, choosing whatever key binding you find convenient:

```cson
'atom-text-editor':
  'cmd-alt-o': 'latexer:omnicomplete'
  'cmd-alt-r': 'latexer:insert-reference'
  'cmd-alt-c': 'latexer:insert-citation'
```

LaTeX on Atom
-----------

This package only provides autocompletion. If you want the full LaTeX experience then I would recommend getting the [language-latex](https://atom.io/packages/language-latex) package for syntax highlighting, and the [latex](https://atom.io/packages/latex) or the [latex-plus](https://atom.io/packages/latex-plus) package for compiling LaTeX documents. You can also view pdf documents from within Atom by installing the [pdf-view](https://atom.io/packages/pdf-view) package.
